# Introduction

This code is meant to produce a simple graph of LFM at sites near the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden to raise awareness of fire danger and keep local residents informed.  

Data is typically collected every two weeks from each site. Samples are collected and dried in accordance with USFS recommendations. This code has been forked and altered from Josie Lesage's original code, as data has been updated and changed.

```{r data, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

#reading in data, cleaning it
rwmp_raw <- read.csv(here("data", "LFM_PaintedCave_data_042024.csv")) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(species = recode_factor(species,
                                 "ADFA" = "Chamise",
                                 "CEME" = "Bigpod ceanothus")) %>%
  mutate(recode_factor(subsite, "Unknown" = ""))

#changing "collection date" column to date class in new column, "date"
rwmp_raw$date <- parse_date_time(rwmp_raw$collection_date, "ymd")

#checking to see if lubridate worked (it did)
class(rwmp_raw$date)

#checking class of lfm bc it needs to be number for analysis
class(rwmp_raw$lfm_perc)
class(rwmp_raw$lfm)

#changing class
rwmp_raw$lfm_perc <- as.numeric(rwmp_raw$lfm_perc)

#check to see if it worked 
class(rwmp_raw$lfm_perc)
#it did! class is now "numeric"

#creating new filtered dataframe with mean LFM values and new site column
lfm <- rwmp_raw %>%
  filter(concern != "Yes") %>%
  group_by(date, site, species, subsite) %>%
  summarise(meanLFM = mean(lfm_perc),
            seLFM = std.error(lfm_perc)) %>%
  mutate(site2 = site,
         species2 = species) %>%
